# Analyzing the Supply Chain Network Created from the Conventional Relation Extraction Model and Chat-GPT: Focusing On S&P 500 Companies

## Overview
This project aims to provide insights into company activities by structuring and analyzing textual data from financial reports.

## Process
1. **Sentence Selection**: Extract sentences from the 10-K reports of S&P 500 companies that describe their annual activities.
2. **Node Extraction**: Utilize a Relation Extraction (RE) model to extract key nodes from the selected sentences. We employed Chat-GPT and the SSAN (Structured Self-Attention Network) model for this process.
3. **Relationship Analysis & Visualization**: Identify relationships between extracted nodes, determine key nodes, and visualize their connections.

## Results
1. **Performance Evaluation**: We assess the effectiveness of Chat-GPT as an RE model by comparing it with existing RE techniques(SSAN).
2. **Automated Pipeline Development**: We propose an automated pipeline that generates a supply chain network using Chat-GPT and RE models.
3. **Network Analysis & Visualization**: By analyzing the supply chain networks of S&P 500 companies, we extract key nodes (central nodes) and key paths (main routes) and visualize their relationships.
